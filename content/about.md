# About Me

Hello, I'm Halil Arda Özongun, a passionate Computer Science student at Bilkent University with a minor in Mathematics. My interests are deep learning, competitive programming and the mathematics underneath. I am currently working under [Asst. Prof. Ayşegül Dündar](https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~adundar/) in the [DLR Lab](https://dlr.bilkent.edu.tr/) on single-stage diffusion models and [Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/) on improving image quality in low light using deep learning algorithms.

Through this website, I aim to share my projects, thoughts, and experiences in the tech world.

Feel free to explore my work and get in touch!
